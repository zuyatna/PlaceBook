# PlaceBook

PlaceBook starts by displaying a Google Map centered around your current location. 
The map will display common places, and allow you to bookmark them. 
You can display details for bookmarked places and edit the place data and a corresponding photo.

The navigation drawer on the left will display all of your bookmarks, and tapping on one will zoom the map to that location. 
You can use the search icon to find nearby places and jump directly to them on the map.
